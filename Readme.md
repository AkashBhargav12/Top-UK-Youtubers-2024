# Objective

- What is the key objective of the project?

To discover the top performing UK Youtubers to form marketing collaborations with, throughout the year 2024.


- What is the best solution?

  To create a Dashboard that provides insights into the top UK Youtubers in 2024 which includes
  - Subscriber COunt
  - Total Views
  - Total Videos, and
  - Engagement Metrics

  This data will help the marketing team make informed decision about which Youtubers to collaborate with for marketing campaigns, to obtain maximum returns.


## User Story

As the Head of Marketing, I want to identify the top YouTubers in the UK based on subscriber count, videos uploaded and views accumulated, so that I can decide on which channels would be best to run marketing campaigns with to generate a good ROI.


# Data source 

- What data is needed to achieve our objective?

We need data on the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their 
- Channel Names
- Total Subscribers
- Total Views
- Total Videos Uploaded

  
- Where is the data coming from? 
The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [see here to find it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download)

- Analysis


# Design

## Dashboard components required 
- What should the dashboard contain based on the requirements provided?

To understand what it should contain, we need to figure out what questions we need the dashboard to answer:

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?
  
  
## Dashboard mockup

- What should it look like? 

Some of the data visuals that may be appropriate in answering our questions include:

1. Table
2. Treemap
3. Scorecards
4. Horizontal bar chart

## Tools Used


| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Excel | Exploring the data |
| SQL Server | Cleaning, testing, and analyzing the data |
| Power BI | Visualizing the data via interactive dashboards |
| GitHub | Hosting the project documentation |
| Mokkup AI | Designing the mockup of the dashboard | 


# Development

## Pseudocode

- How can we approach the problem to create a solution from start to finish?

  1. Get the data from a reliable data source
  2. Explore the data in Excel to check for any errors that standout
  3. Load the data into SQL Server
  4. Clean the data with SQL
  5. Test the data with SQL
  6. Load the clean data into PowerBI
  7. Generate visualisations of the data in PowerBI
  8. Generate the findings based on the insights
  9. Write the documentation + commentary
  10. Publish the insights generated


## Data exploration notes

This is the stage where we scan the data for errors, inconcsistencies, bugs, weird and corrupted characters etc. 


- What are the initial observations with this dataset? What's caught our attention so far? 

1. There are at least 4 columns that contain the data we need for this analysis, which signals we have everything we need from the file without needing to contact the client for any more data. 
2. The first column contains the channel ID with what appears to be channel IDS, which are separated by a @ symbol - we need to extract the channel names from this.
3. Some of the cells and header names are in a different language - we need to confirm if these columns are needed, and if so, we need to address them.
4. We have more data than we need, so some of these columns would need to be removed


## Data cleaning 
- What do we expect the clean data to look like? What should it contain? What contraints should we apply to it?

The aim is to refine the dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. 

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria and constraints:

- Only relevant columns should be retained.
- All data types should be appropriate for the contents of each column.
- No column should contain null values, indicating complete data for all records.
